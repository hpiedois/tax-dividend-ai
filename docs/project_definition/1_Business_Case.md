# Business Case: Tax Dividend AI

## 1. Problem Statement
Cross-border investors, specifically Swiss residents holding French securities, face significant challenges in avoiding double taxation on dividends.
- **Complexity**: The process involves specific forms (5000, 5001) that are difficult to understand for individuals.
- **Inefficiency**: Manual paper handling, risk of missed deadlines, and lack of support from mainstream brokers (e.g., Swissquote) for retail clients.
- **Financial Loss**: Without proper "relief at source" or reclaim procedures, investors lose a significant portion of their returns to foreign withholding taxes.

## 2. Solution Overview
A SaaS platform to automate the tax reclaim process:
- **For Individuals (B2C)**: specialized "Tax Assistant" that imports broker data, calculates reclaimable amounts, and generates pre-filled forms (5000/5001) with a step-by-step submission checklist.
- **For Professionals (B2B)**: Multi-tenant platform for fiduciaries, family offices, and wealth managers to process reclaims for multiple clients efficiently.

## 3. Market Analysis
### Target Audience
1.  **Individual Investors**: Swiss residents with French stocks (PEA/CTO equivalents) using brokers like Swissquote, IBKR, etc.
2.  **Fiduciaries**: Small to medium firms handling tax returns for cross-border commuters or wealthy clients.
3.  **Family Offices/Wealth Managers**: Seeking to automate low-value administrative tasks.

### Competitive Advantage
- **Automation**: Direct import of dividend statements (PDF/CSV).
- **Expertise**: Built-in tax logic for the France-Switzerland convention.
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed to support other country pairs in the future (e.g., Germany-Switzerland).

## 4. Monetization Strategy
- **B2C**: Freemium or one-off fee per tax year/report. Annual subscription for "peace of mind".
- **B2B**: SaaS subscription based on number of managed clients/portfolios, plus potential setup fees. High value due to time savings.
